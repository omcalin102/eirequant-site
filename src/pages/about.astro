        <p class="lede">
          I am a young engineer with an appetite for building things that work in the real world.
          EireQuant is my flagship project and the place where I learn, test, and publish ideas in
          quantitative finance, macro economics and machine learning at my own pace. It is a long-running project
          that lets me explore methods and turn them into something that
          looks and behaves like a real investment stack.

        <p>
          I like hard problems, opportunities to grow and collaboration with like minded driven peers. Outside study and EireQuant I
          keep a simple routine that balances reading, training, and time with friends and family. I enjoy
          football, running, and travelling whenever I get the time. I read broadly across
          markets, engineering, and history, and I keep notes that often turn into ideas for the
          project. I work best when I own the outcome from idea to delivery and I love working with others, 
          both in leadership and non leading roles.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h3 class="h3">Technical range</h3>
        <p>
          My mathematical grounding is solid in advanced calculus, linear algebra, probability, and
          stochastic processes, with active practice through modelling work. On the engineering side
          I have shipped end to end pieces across data ingestion, feature building, and model
          training, and I have moved that work into live use through scheduling, testing, and careful
          monitoring. University projects added breadth in control systems where PID thinking maps
          well to risk pacing and drawdown control, embedded design where constraints force
          discipline, and general coding where data structures and presentation matter as much as
          the models. I have hands-on practice with classical machine learning and growing experience
          in deep learning with my final year project being an investigation into "Short Term Electricity Forecasting". I put real effort into evaluation,
          calibration, and clear reporting, when something fails I debug it methodically and I note
          what I learned.

          I supported two projects that had to land cleanly. The first was test planning and
          execution for transition from the legacy system to the new modern frontend. The second was controlled movement of
          broker data to ensure all data was up to date. I built a set of Excel functions and checks
          that teams could run themselves which cut hand-offs and made sign-off faster.

          I design and run a daily research stack that publishes model behaviour, equity curves,

          evaluation, and a public front end that explains the output clearly.

      <h2 class="card-title">Q&amp;A</h2>
      <div class="card-sub">A few direct answers</div>
    </header>

    <details class="qa" open>
      <summary>Why did you create EireQuant?</summary>
      <p>
        The project began as a personal attempt to bring finance and engineering together in a
        single place that I could own end to end.
        I wanted something close to a small research shop where I could decide the focus,
        build the tools, and carry the results through to publication. That structure lets me rotate
        between model design, data engineering, reporting, and product decisions which is a better
        way for me to learn and a better test of whether ideas hold up.
      </p>
    </details>

    <details class="qa">
      <summary>What are the near-term plans?</summary>
      <p>
        I am building the second Core model and tightening the production routines that support it.
        I am also planning weekly articles that would link current events to concrete parts of the system.
        The writing forces clarity and keeps me honest about what is working. Time is tight around
        final year study so any time dedicated to the project must be specific and focused.
      </p>
    </details>

    <details class="qa">
      <summary>What has been the most difficult part so far?</summary>
      <p>
        Moving from static backtests to a live daily pipeline changed everything. Time zones,
        missing ticks, delayed files, and external services all fail at some point and the code
        has to handle that without drama. The other challenge is the simple fact that ideas are easy for me to outline
        yet actual implementation takes time. I often knew what I wanted the system to do before I had the
        skill to code it which meant I was limited most of the time by my coding ability. The answer has been steady practice, smaller steps, and better tests. As
        the system grows the hard part is choosing focus so that progress compounds rather than
        scattering effort.
      </p>
    </details>

    <details class="qa">
      <summary>Which industries and roles interest you most?</summary>
      <p>
        I am drawn to fixed income trading where decisions are grounded in data and discipline. The
        mix of macro signals, micro structure, and risk control suits the way I think. I want to
        work with people who like to build rather than talk about building, who care about clean
        execution, and who are comfortable owning outcomes. This project matters to me and I would like to collaborate with like-minded driven individuals who hold a similar interest as myself.
      </p>
    </details>

    <details class="qa">
      <summary>How should someone explore the work?</summary>
      <p>
        The website is the front door. The model card shows performance and controls, the pipeline
        pages show the daily state of the system, and the compare page lets you judge risk and
        reward quickly. A whitepaper is on the way and will stitch the methods together so that
        readers can deep-dive into all theoretical parts of the backend design.

    </header>
    <ol class="tenets">
      <li>
        Design every layer with intention. Use modern methods where they truly add value and keep
        the rest simple and reliable.
      </li>
      <li>
        Test strategies with care and publish calibration so that readers can judge stability, not
        just headline returns.
      </li>
      <li>
        Favour clarity. If a non technical reader cannot follow the logic then I have more work to
        do.
      </li>
      <li>
        Keep code and data organised. Neat systems fail less and are easier to extend.
      </li>
      <li>
        Be honest about results. Fix root causes, write down lessons, and only then move on.
